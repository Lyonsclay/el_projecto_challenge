In order to decrease a user's perception of waiting when some functions take a lot of time you need to give them an indication that something is happening. Most commonly, animation is used in some way to indicate activity; typically you have a series of small rotating circles or something like that.

Even better is to have a progress bar or some other measure of how much of a process has occurred and how much is left.

It can be helpful to add an element of surprise or uniqueness to the UX so a creative message about waiting or an unexpected or unusual animation can diminish a user's boredom when waiting for something to happen. 

Ultimately though, long wait times are bad:(
